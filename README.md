# Stock-Analysis-Application
A prototype desktop application to demonstrate various java design principles and MVC design architecture to perform CRUD operations and visualize the data using real time stocks. 

Real-time stock prices were retrieved from the AlphaVantage API and portfolio details were stored and retreived from XML. 

Design was open to access the features using command line and/or graphical user interface (or any other UI if in future). GUI was implemented using Java Swing.

Note: To follow the university's academic integrity policy, the source code has been kept private. If any details/ doubts pertaining to the project is required I request you to please ping me on LinkedIn.
